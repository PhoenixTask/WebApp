**Phoenix Task** is a lightweight and fun task management application built with modern web technologies.  
The frontend is developed using **Next.js**, and the backend is powered by **ASP.NET Core** â€” hosted in a separate repository:

ðŸ”— Backend Repository: [PhoenixTaskApi](https://github.com/ErfanMelon/PhoenixTaskApi)

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project began as a fun and experimental initiative by a couple of developers who wanted to build a simple yet scalable task manager.  
While the main intention was exploration and enjoyment, **Phoenix Task** has the potential to evolve into a dedicated task management system for internal company use.

You can either host it as-is, or fork and customize it to fit your own needs.
